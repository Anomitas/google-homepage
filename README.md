For this mini-project, you’ll deconstruct an existing web page and rebuild it. In this case we will use the google homepage as the file suggests.

Don’t worry if the links don’t go anywhere and the search box doesn’t do anything when you submit it. The goal is to start thinking about how elements get placed on the page and roughly how they get styled and aligned.
